# ISPy3
Tools for Integrated-light Spectroscopy with Python3

ISPy3 is a collection of Python routines that can be used to model and analyse the integrated-light spectra of stellar populations. 
The actual spectral synthesis and related tasks (setting up model atmospheres, etc) is done via external codes. 
Currently, the Kurucz codes (ATLAS/SYNTHE) and MARCS/TurboSpectrum are supported
